javaScript / ECMAScript
-----------------------

javaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 in 10 days.

It was developed for Netscap 2, and became the ECMA-262 stander in 1997

After Netscap handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to developed JavaScript for the firefox browser.
